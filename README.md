This project builds a small controller that connects to a GoPro and automatically notes when recording starts and stops. It saves 
clean timestamps and clip info so footage can be organized and downloaded to a Mac without manual steps.Aligns each clip’s start/stop 
timestamps with the song’s timecode and auto-export edit markers/EDLs, so the NLE opens to a pre-assembled timeline already synced to the soundtrack.
